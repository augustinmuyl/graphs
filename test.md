# Test

1.
2. Implement metrics/spectral.py (L, Lsym, Lrw + lambda2, lambda_n, lambda_n/lambda2, optional Kirchhoff).
3. Implement metrics/robustness.py (GCC fraction, components count, avg shortest path in GCC).
4. Implement attacks/node_attacks.py (random, degree, betweenness, Fiedler-magnitude).
5. Build experiments/run_single.py to run one graph/attack and write CSV.
6. Add experiments/sweep.py for batch runs.
7. Plotting script.
