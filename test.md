# Test

- create various graphs
- test various random failures (node and edge removals)
- compute graph metrics before and after failures (spectrum, algebraic connectivity, range, etc.)
- analyze the impact of failures on graph properties

| algebraic connectivity | range |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| 1.01_ | 0 |
| 0.85_ | 2 |
